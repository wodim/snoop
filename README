This is an addon for World of Warcraft which prints to a window everything
that's said by you or other players in the "hidden" addon channel in a party,
guild, or in private.

It works with the 3.3.5a version of the client, but it probably works in more
recent or older versions as well.

To use it, enable this addon and create two chat tabs (right click the "General"
tab, then "Create New Window") and call them "sp" and "sw". The "sp" window will
show messages sent by other players while the "sw" window will show messages
sent by Warden/Sentinel/etc.
